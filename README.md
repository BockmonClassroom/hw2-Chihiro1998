Detail: Question answer for DS5110 HW2

## Date Collections
### 1.Explain your data collection process
I chose to collect data from potted plants in the coffee shop where I used to study, because it is not a good season to go to the botanical garden, and the trees outside the school are too tall for me. I collected data from three different plants: Zamioculcas zamiifolia, Snake plant and Bunny ears cactus. I randomly selected 10 leaves from each plant for measurement, using the App Measure to measure distance and a regular ruler to record their leaf width and leaf length, and confirmed the plant name through the plant identification App - PictureThis. My collection work detail is mainly as follows：<br>
**Location**： K Coffee Bar<br>
**Step 1** Once I have found the plant, use the mobile app PictureThis to identify the plant species and mark the area.<br>
**Step 2** Use a ruler to measure the length and width of each leaf in millimeters.<br>
**Step 3** Record the measurements and the plant name in a notebook and then transcribe them into a spreadsheet.<br>
**Step 4** Repeat the above steps until I have collected data for all three plants.<br>

### 2.What instrument did you use to collect data with? 
During the data collection process, I used the following tools:<br>
Ruler: A regular ruler. If there is a caliper, the data will be more accurate, but I didn’t buy it.<br>
Mobile application (PictureThis and Measure): used to identify the species and name of plants and to preliminarily measure the length and width of plant leaves.<br>
Notebook and pen: used to manually record measurement data and preliminarily mark the data measurement points.<br>
Spreadsheet tool (Google Sheets): used to organize and store data.<br>
